# Lights-of-Story
Let storys become lights for everyone


I want to develop a novel forum based on IC. You know the novels written by Chinese writers are popular all over the world recently. The core idea of developing this forum is to make reading without borders, and the happiness of reading should belong to the whole world. 

My ideas are as follows: 
    1. The original author updates the content and publishes it all over the world, or publishes the completed works quickly;
    2. The readers in the audience can claim part of the translation work, on the one hand, they can translate in real time, on the other hand, they can quickly complete the translation of the existing works.
    3.After the original author sends the article, the readers in the same language as the author will score it, and the high score works will be recommended to the readers in different language regions for translation, and the translation can get benefits.
    4.Two models of reward：Author—Reader & Author—Translator—Reader.
